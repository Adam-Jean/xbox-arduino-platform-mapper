# Control Modes Explained - Marble Balancing Guide

## 🎯 The Key Difference

### Velocity Control (Rate) - **RECOMMENDED FOR MARBLE**
**Joystick controls HOW FAST the platform tilts**

- **Center stick** = Platform holds current angle (no change)
- **Push stick right** = Platform gradually tilts more and more right
- **Full stick** = Platform tilts at maximum speed
- **Release stick** = Platform STAYS at current angle

**Why this is perfect for balancing a marble:**
- ✅ Make tiny, precise adjustments
- ✅ Platform doesn't fight you (no spring-back to center)
- ✅ Intuitive: lean stick = marble rolls that direction
- ✅ Much less sensitive - you have control!

### Position Control (Direct) - **NOT RECOMMENDED**
**Joystick position = platform angle directly**

- **Center stick** = Platform at 0° (level)
- **Push stick right** = Platform immediately tilts to that angle
- **Full stick** = Maximum angle instantly
- **Release stick** = Platform SNAPS back to center

**Why this is bad for marble balancing:**
- ❌ Way too sensitive
- ❌ Platform always wants to return to center
- ❌ Hard to make fine adjustments
- ❌ Marble gets thrown around

## 🎮 Velocity Control Settings Explained

### Control Speed Slider
**What it does:** Sets how fast the platform tilts when you hold the stick

| Setting | Speed | When to Use |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **5-15°/s** | Very slow | Large marbles, beginners, precise control |
| **20-40°/s** | Medium | **RECOMMENDED for most use** |
| **50-70°/s** | Fast | Small marbles, quick corrections |
| **80-100°/s** | Very fast | Expert mode, tiny marbles |

**Example:**
- Control Speed = 30°/s
- Hold stick full right for 1 second → Platform tilts 30° to the right
- Hold stick half right for 2 seconds → Platform tilts 30° to the right (slower rate)

### Max Angle Slider
**What it does:** Limits how far the platform can tilt

| Setting | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **10-20°** | Flat platform, large marble, beginners |
| **30-45°** | **RECOMMENDED** - good range for most setups |
| **60-90°** | Very steep platform, tiny marble, experts |

**Safety tip:** Start with 20° and increase gradually!

### Deadzone Slider
**What it does:** Ignores tiny stick movements near center

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **0.05** | Very sensitive (worn controller might drift) |
| **0.08** | **RECOMMENDED** - good balance |
| **0.15** | Less sensitive (good for shaky hands) |
| **0.20+** | Very insensitive (hard to make small adjustments) |

## 🎯 Recommended Settings for Marble Balancing

### Beginner Setup
```
Control Mode: Velocity Control (Rate)
Control Speed: 20°/s
Max Angle: 20°
Deadzone: 0.10
```
**Why:** Slow, forgiving, won't let platform tilt too much

### Intermediate Setup (Recommended)
```
Control Mode: Velocity Control (Rate)
Control Speed: 30°/s
Max Angle: 35°
Deadzone: 0.08
```
**Why:** Good balance of control and responsiveness

### Advanced Setup
```
Control Mode: Velocity Control (Rate)
Control Speed: 50°/s
Max Angle: 45°
Deadzone: 0.05
```
**Why:** Fast corrections, full range of motion

### Expert Setup
```
Control Mode: Velocity Control (Rate)
Control Speed: 70°/s
Max Angle: 60°
Deadzone: 0.05
```
**Why:** Maximum responsiveness and range

## 🧪 How to Find Your Perfect Settings

### Step 1: Start Conservative
1. Set Control Speed to 20°/s
2. Set Max Angle to 20°
3. Test moving the stick around
4. Notice how the platform gradually tilts

### Step 2: Adjust Speed
1. Hold stick full right and count how long to reach max angle
2. **Too slow?** Increase Control Speed
3. **Too twitchy?** Decrease Control Speed
4. Goal: Should take 1-2 seconds to reach max angle at full stick

### Step 3: Adjust Max Angle
1. Tilt platform to maximum
2. **Not tilting enough for marble to roll?** Increase Max Angle
3. **Marble rolling too fast?** Decrease Max Angle
4. Goal: Marble should roll at a manageable speed

### Step 4: Fine-tune Deadzone
1. Center the stick and watch the platform
2. **Platform drifting?** Increase Deadzone
3. **Hard to make tiny adjustments?** Decrease Deadzone
4. Goal: Platform stays put when stick is centered

## 🎮 Control Techniques for Marble Balancing

### The "Nudge" Technique
1. Marble rolling left (unwanted)
2. Tap stick right briefly
3. Platform tilts slightly right
4. Marble slows down
5. Return stick to center
6. Platform holds new angle

### The "Follow" Technique
1. Want marble to roll right
2. Hold stick right gently
3. Platform gradually tilts right
4. Marble starts rolling
5. Ease stick back to slow it down
6. Center stick when marble is where you want it

### The "Catch" Technique
1. Marble rolling fast to the right
2. Push stick right (same direction!)
3. Platform tilts right to "catch" the marble
4. Marble slows down as platform meets it
5. Ease stick back to center
6. Platform levels out with marble controlled

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Platform keeps tilting even when I center the stick!"
**Solution:**
- This is actually correct! In Velocity mode, centering the stick means "hold current angle"
- To return to level: gently push stick opposite direction until platform reaches 0°, then center

### Problem: "It's still too sensitive!"
**Solutions:**
1. Decrease Control Speed (try 15°/s or even 10°/s)
2. Increase Deadzone (try 0.15)
3. Decrease Max Angle (try 15°)

### Problem: "Platform moves too slowly!"
**Solutions:**
1. Increase Control Speed (try 40-50°/s)
2. Decrease Deadzone (try 0.05)

### Problem: "I can't get the platform back to level!"
**Solution:**
- Watch the angle display at the top
- Gently push stick in opposite direction
- When angle shows ~0°, center the stick

### Problem: "Platform drifts even with stick centered"
**Solutions:**
1. Increase Deadzone to 0.12-0.15
2. Your controller might have stick drift - try a different controller
3. Recalibrate controller in Windows settings

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start each session at level:** When you first connect, nudge platform back to 0° before placing marble

2. **Use visual feedback:** Watch the angle numbers at top of screen, not just the platform

3. **Small movements:** You rarely need full stick deflection - 30-50% is usually enough

4. **Practice without marble first:** Get a feel for the controls before adding the marble

5. **Predictive control:** Push stick slightly BEFORE marble gets to edge (like steering a car)

6. **Reset button:** If platform gets tilted crazy, just gently guide it back to 0° watching the numbers

7. **Emergency level:** If marble falls off, quickly center the platform:
   - Look at current angle
   - Gently push stick opposite direction
   - Center when numbers show ~0°
